Information about the project is located in PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md. Make sure to update it whenever you make significant changes like:
1. Adding a new endpoint
2. Using a major new technology/package
3. Use a new service to connect to


Make sure the description is breif and to the point. If the prompt needs more context, it will get it from the code.

When adding new code, try not to add useless comments. No need to describe something that the code easily describes.

For example, this comment isn't needed:
```
// Convert product links to affiliate links
const productsWithAffiliateLinks =
    affiliateService.convertProductLinks(processedProducts);
```
